# Angular-like Framework from Scratch

This is a **simple Angular-like framework** built from scratch using plain JavaScript. It demonstrates core features like **components**, **routing**, **data binding**, **pipes**, and **services**. The framework is designed to be lightweight and easy to understand, making it a great learning resource for understanding how modern front-end frameworks work under the hood.

## Features

- **Components**: Reusable UI elements with templates and logic.
- **Routing**: Hash-based routing to navigate between components.
- **Data Binding**: Interpolation (`{{ }}`) to bind data to the template.
- **Pipes**: Transform data before displaying it (e.g., `uppercase` pipe).
- **Services**: Share data and logic across components (e.g., `dataService`).
- **HTTP Client**: Fetch data from APIs using a simple HTTP client.
